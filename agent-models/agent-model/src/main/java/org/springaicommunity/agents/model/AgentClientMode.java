/**
 * Controls the default permissiveness of AgentClient across all providers.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code LOOSE} (default): Permissive defaults that work out of the box in any directory
 * with minimal preconditions. Designed for evaluation and development where friction
 * during onboarding is the primary failure mode.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code STRICT}: Conservative defaults that require explicit opt-in to potentially risky
 * operations. Designed for production environments where safety is prioritized over
 * convenience.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each provider translates the mode into its own concrete defaults. For example, Codex
 * sets {@code skipGitCheck=true} in LOOSE mode and {@code skipGitCheck=false} in STRICT
 * mode.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>STRICT is a baseline, not a lock.</strong> Explicit provider-specific property
 * overrides always take precedence over mode-derived defaults. See the defaults
 * philosophy documentation for details.
 *
 * <p>
 * The SDK layer remains neutral on policy — mode translation is exclusively an
 * agent-models concern. Direct SDK consumers are never affected by AgentClientMode.
